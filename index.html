        I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable.
        I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament.
        Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with.
        You either have it or you don't.

        Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes! All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me
        - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. Lorem Ipsum best not make any more
        threats to your website. It will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
        Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next
        webpage?! I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't
        know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots
        of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400
        pounds. Ok?
